# Python Numpy Basics and Image Processing

This project demonstrates basic usage of NumPy, saving `.npy` files, and simple image processing to convert a light mode image to dark mode.

## Contents

- **NumPy Basics:**  
   Learn how to create and manipulate arrays using NumPy.

- **Saving `.npy` Files:**  
   Save NumPy arrays to disk for later use.

- **Image Processing:**  
   Convert a light mode image to dark mode using NumPy operations.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

2. **Run the Code:**
   - Explore the scripts to see examples of NumPy basics.
   - Check how arrays are saved and loaded with `.npy` files.
   - See how an image is inverted to create a dark mode effect.
